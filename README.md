# Project Starling

Exploring an approach to OpenMob using dGraph to build a graphql server. Dgraph's native graphql features are in early stages of development and
it remains to be seen if this is a viable approach. Especially interested in how to federate Dgraphs graphQL API through a GO graphQL server
providing extended queries, business logic, real time subscriptions, and resource level permissions.
